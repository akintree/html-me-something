            <em>Way of Kings</em> (Stormlight Archive book 1)
        </p>
        
        <p id="mainText">Brandon Sanderson writes fantasy books with detailed, in-depth worldbuilding (including some cool magic systems), fantastic character development, and really good plot twists and groundshaking revelations! The Mistborn series and the Stormlight Archive series are both good examples of this. Mistborn is set in a world where the Great Evil&#174 (known in this series as the Lord Ruler) won a thousand years ago, and has had a stranglehold on things ever since. In the first book, an unlikely group bands together to stop him... but that's only the beginning. The challenges and mysteries surrounding the Lord Ruler and their world itself keep growing from there. <br>The second series is set about 300 years after the first series, and I love how society has advanced in that time! The original trilogy was set in medieval-ish times, while the second season is sort of a Steampunk Western situation. I enjoy how the world is allowed to change and develop while still being very recognizable!</p>

        <p id="mainText">Technically Frances Hardinge writes children's/young adult books but do I care? Nope! Honestly kids books can be just as good and interesting as books for adults, and they tend not to have a lot of romance, which is refreshing sometimes. Her books have really imaginative settings and stories that often involve coming of age, dealing with identity, and found family. We have a story of sisters, of people that can send their senses far from their bodies, and of (possibly) sentient mountains - that also touches on colonialism and the injustice and tensions that linger even generations later; we have a tale of political factions vying for power with a young girl, a goose, and a conman caught in the middle; we have an unsettling but intriguing book about a girl who has a number of very strange things happen to her, that lead to her fighting for her individuality and her life (and bonding with her sister in the process); we have a story set in the time of the Revolutionary War of a girl who can see ghosts, and who gradually discovers her own strength, intelligence, and agency. They're books you can fall right into, and I love them.</p>
        
        <h2>Neil Gaiman</h2>

            <p id="description">    
                <em>Smoke and Mirrors</em> </p>
            <p id="description">    
                <em>Trigger Warnings</em></p>
            
        <p id="mainText">Neil Gaiman is also very imaginative! His books can be whimsical and funny in parts, but also very moving. And haunting, in the case of <em>Coraline</em>. <em>Good Omens</em> makes the Apocalypse fun, and involves an angel and a demon being mostly useless but also very endearing. <em>Smoke and Mirrors</em> and <em>Trigger Warnings</em> are both collections of short stories and poems, and I like the variety - they've got Lovecraftian Sherlock Holmes, reimagined fairytales, genuinely spooky stories, and many other interesting things.</p>
        
        <h2>Jim Butcher</h2>
    <p id="description">
        <img src="images/dresdenFiles.png" alt="The Dresden Files"><br>
        <em>The Dresden Files</em></p>
       
        <p id="mainText">The Dresden Files are urban fantasy, and very inspired by noir mysteries. They're fast paced, engaging reads, and I love the character development and the way each book builds on the others. Harry Dresden is your typical hardboiled PI, but he's also a wizard. He's a distaster and sometimes too rash and too angry for his own good, and he's also, deep down, a very good person. Most importantly, he grows and learns from his mistakes! He's a great protagonist, and the other characters you meet throughout the series are wonderful too.</p>
        
        <h2>Seanan McGuire</h2>

            <p id="description">Wayward Children series </p>
            <p id="description">Indexing series </p>
            <p id="description">InCryptid series (books 1-5)</p>
        
        <p id="mainText">Seanan McGuire is both an incredibly creative and incredibly prolific writer. In addition to the books I have listed here, she's written The October Daye series, about a Changeling private investigator who lives in San Fransisco, as well as several horror series under the pseudonym Mira Grant. If you like fairytales and folklore you may like her books! In the first of the books I do show here, we have kids like Dorothy and Alice who went through portals into other worlds and had grand adventures and ultimately returned home - only in the Wayward Children series, these kids desperately want to go <em>back</em>. It's very bittersweet and magical, and the concepts for the other worlds are fascinating. The Indexing series has a great squad of characters who essentially fight weaponized fairytales, and the interpretation of those fairytales can be both horrifying and extremely cool. InCryptid deals with a family of cryptozoologists, and it's really entertaining - this series is fast-paced and fun to read.</p>
